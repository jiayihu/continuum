\begin{abstract}
Dramatic improvements in mobile connectivity combined with the productivity of Web-level programming have caused the Internet of the past to turn into a ubiquitous platform where a multitude of web services are developed, deployed and employed at various locations. The resulting multitude of heterogeneous computing nodes, ranging from clusters of compute nodes via consumer devices to industrial sensors and actuators, compels envisioning a seamless integration of the Cloud and the Internet of Things into a single Continuum.\par
Although already spoken of in some vision statements, the Continuum still is a very novel notion for technology. Its concrete realisation demands cutting-edge solutions from various ambits of Cloud, Edge and Web software development. This paper presents a high-level reference architecture for the Continuum accompanied with a Proof of Concept implementation of an infrastructure layer for it, which helps gauge the distance between various state-of-the-art technologies and their integration, with the proposed vision.\par
The findings presented in this work show that several technology solutions have organically sprouted in recent years, which very well fit the Continuum, suggesting natural convergence towards it. However, a substantial gap in terms of viability still remains, whose bridging calls for serious community effort.
