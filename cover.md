Dear Editor,

We are writing to resubmit our paper, titled "An architectural view on the Compute Continuum: challenges and technologies" to the Journal of Systems and Software. We have made significant revisions to the previous manuscript, entitled "The Continuum of Computing: a seamless ubiquitous service-oriented platform to unite the Edge to the Cloud", based on the feedback provided by the reviewers. We are confident that the revised work is now more fit for the publication.

The changes we have made to the paper include a focus on making the paper more concise and solid, as well as updating the references to be more modern and offering a comparison to comparable recent publications in the field. In particular, we have made the paper more concentrated on the contributions we made regarding the Continuum of Computing. We highlight the significance of a work that explores the use of state-of-the-art open-source technologies for building a proof of concept for the Continuum that can be application-agnostic and capable of supporting data locality and computational mobility. We believe that these revisions address the concerns raised by the reviewers and strengthen the overall contribution of the paper.

We would like to thank the Editor and the reviewers for their valuable feedback, which has helped us to improve the quality of the paper. We hope that the revised manuscript will meet the standards of the Journal of Systems and Software for publication.

Thank you for considering our revised submission.

Sincerely,
